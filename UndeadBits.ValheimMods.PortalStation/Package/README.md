# Description

This mod was created for anyone which is disappointed by how portals work in Valheim.
It adds a new building piece called the "Portal Station" and an item named "Personal Teleportation Device".

# Portal Stations

Portal stations are capabable of teleporting players from any station to all other ones and also do not have teleportation restrictions on resources.
However, they are more expensive to build than regular portals as they require 4 surtling cores, 20 stone and 20 Greydraw Eyes.

# Personal Teleportation Device

The "Personal Teleportation Device" item can be used to quickly teleport from any location to nearby portal stations.
They can be built at the forge (level 3+) with 3 surtling cores, 10 leather scraps and 10 iron nails and come with 2 quality upgrades.

Each teleportation will cost 1 Greydwarf Eye per 1000m and also adds some wear to it (can be repaired at a forge).
Each quality update will add an additional 1000m of travel distance and increases the items durability so it can be used more often until it breaks.
